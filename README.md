# anusplin_pro


Anusplin_pro is a C++ program to run the Anusplin program in batch mode.
Anusplin is suit of program which can be used to generate climate forcing data for climate change related numerical simulations.
More information of these programs can be found here: https://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/research/products/anusplin

In order to run these programs on a high performance computer, I developed this tool to prepare, setup and run Anusplin without user interference.
Application of this tool has been used to generate climate data for three of my scientific publications.
