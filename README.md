# anusplin_pro


Anusplin_pro is a C++ program to run the Anusplin program in batch mode.

Anusplin is a suit of program which can be used to generate climate forcing data for climate change related numerical simulations.
More information of these programs can be found here: https://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/research/products/anusplin

In order to generate time series of gridded climate data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) on a high performance computer, I developed this tool to prepare, setup and run Anusplin programs without user interference.

Applications of this tool have been used to generate climate data for three of my scientific publications.
